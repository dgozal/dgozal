### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Derrick Gozal, a grad student currently taking Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at Columbia University. I am an expert dilettante and well-versed in the art of decision paralysis. I have for the last several years for instance, been unable to decide whether I should throw the towel and focus on Economics, Politics, History, Philosophy, or Literature. So I do the next best thing instead and try to do all of them (with an added dose of data science and programming for good measure). I am very much interested in any interdisciplinary work that stands at the intersection of all the above mentioned fields!
